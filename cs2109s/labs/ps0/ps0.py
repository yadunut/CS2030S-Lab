def average_increase_in_cases(n_cases_increase, n_adj_entries_avg=7):
    '''
    Averages the increase in cases for each day using data from the previous
    `n_adj_entries_avg` number of days and the next `n_adj_entries_avg` number
    of days.
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_cases_increase: np.ndarray
        2D `ndarray` with each row representing the data of a country, and the columns
        of each row representing the time series data of the daily increase in the
        number of confirmed cases in that country, i.e. the ith row of 
        `n_cases_increase` contains the data of the ith country, and the (i, j) entry of
        `n_cases_increase` is the daily increase in the number of confirmed cases on the
        (j + 1)th day in the ith country.
    n_adj_entries_avg: int
        Number of days from which data will be used to compute the average increase
        in cases. This should be a positive integer.
    
    Returns
    -------
    Mean increase in cases for each day, using data from the previous
    `n_adj_entries_avg` number of days and the next `n_adj_entries_avg` number
    of days, as a 2D `ndarray` such that the (i, j) entry represents the
    average increase in daily cases on the (j + 1)th day in the ith country,
    rounded down to the smallest integer.
    
    The average increase in cases for a particular country on the (j + 1)th day
    is given by the mean of the daily increase in cases over the interval
    [-`n_adj_entries_avg` + j, `n_adj_entries_avg` + j]. (Note: this interval
    includes the endpoints).
    Note
    ----
    Since this computation requires data from the previous `n_adj_entries_avg`
    number of days and the next `n_adj_entries_avg` number of days, it is not
    possible to compute the average for the first and last `n_adj_entries_avg`
    number of days. Therefore, set the average increase in cases for these days
    to `np.nan` for all countries.

def is_peak(n_cases_increase_avg, n_adj_entries_peak=7):
    '''
    Determines whether the (j + 1)th day was a day when the increase in cases
    peaked in the ith country.
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_cases_increase_avg: np.ndarray
        2D `ndarray` with each row representing the data of a country, and the columns
        of each row representing the time series data of the average daily increase in the
        number of confirmed cases in that country, i.e. the ith row of 
        `n_cases_increase` contains the data of the ith country, and the (i, j) entry of
        `n_cases_increase` is the average daily increase in the number of confirmed
        cases on the (j + 1)th day in the ith country. In this case, the 'average'
        is computed using the output from `average_increase_in_cases`.
    n_adj_entries_peak: int
        Number of days that determines the size of the window in which peaks are
        to be detected. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    2D `ndarray` with the (i, j) entry indicating whether there is a peak in the
    daily increase in cases on the (j + 1)th day in the ith country.
    Suppose `a` is the average daily increase in cases, with the (i, j) entry
    indicating the average increase in cases on the (j + 1)th day in the ith
    country. Moreover, let `n_adj_entries_peak` be denoted by `m`.
    In addition, an increase on the (j + 1)th day is deemed significant in the
    ith country if `a[i, j]` is greater than 10 percent of the mean of all
    average daily increases in the country.
    Now, to determine whether there is a peak on the (j + 1)th day in the ith
    country, check whether `a[i, j]` is maximum in {`a[i, j - m]`, `a[i, j - m + 1]`,
    ..., `a[i, j + m - 1]`, `a[i, j + m]`}. If it is and `a[i, j]` is significant,
    then there is a peak on the (j + 1)th day in the ith country; otherwise,
    there is no peak.
    Note
    ----
    Let d = `n_adj_entries_avg` + `n_adj_entries_peak`, where `n_adj_entries_avg`
    is that used to compute `n_cases_increase_avg`. Observe that it is not
    possible to detect a peak in the first and last d days, i.e. these days should
    not be peaks.
    
    As described in `average_increase_in_cases`, to compute the average daily
    increase, we need data from the previous and the next `n_adj_entries_avg`
    number of days. Hence, we won't have an average for these days, precluding
    the computation of peaks during the first and last `n_adj_entries_avg` days.
    Moreover, similar to `average_increase_in_cases`, we need the data over the
    interval [-`n_adj_entries_peak` + j, `n_adj_entries_peak` + j] to determine
    whether the (j + 1)th day is a peak.
    Hint: to determine `n_adj_entries_avg` from `n_cases_increase_avg`,
    `np.count_nonzero` and `np.isnan` may be helpful.
